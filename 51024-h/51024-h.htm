<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the Rt. Hon. W. M. Hughes</span></p>


<p class="drop-capx"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. MacGill</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>From the day on which <cite>The Children
of the Dead End</cite> came into
my hands, I have been amongst the most
devoted of your worshippers. In this and
in your later books, your genius has won
world-wide recognition, and no words of mine
are needed to commend to your very wide
circle of readers this story of the achievements
of the Australian soldiers in France.</p>

<p>The imperishable deeds of Australia's
glorious soldiers have carved for themselves
a deep niche in the topmost towers of the
Temple of the Immortals. The story of their
valour will live throughout the ages, and
future generations of Australians will speak
of them as we do of all the heroic figures of
antiquity, and strive to mould their lives
upon the sublime spirit of self-sacrifice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
love of country and liberty which animated
them. Their valour has covered Australia
with a lustre that shines throughout the
world, so that her name, which but yesterday
was almost unknown, is now a household
word in the mouths of all the peoples of the
earth.</p>

<p>The war has made of Australia&mdash;a young
community without traditions&mdash;a nation,
acutely and proudly conscious of its nationality,
its record in this war, and the great
future which awaits it. Upon that day some
four years gone, when in the grey of early
dawn the Australian soldier leapt upon an
unknown shore and in the face of a murderous
fire scaled the heights of Gaba Tepe&mdash;a feat
of arms almost unparalleled in the history
of war&mdash;the young Australian Commonwealth
put on the toga of manhood, and at one
stride entered on a footing of equality the
family of free nations of the earth. Gallipoli&mdash;scene
of that most glorious attempt which
though falling short of success lost nothing
of its greatness&mdash;thy name is and for ever
will be held sacred to all Australians! In
that fiery furnace of trial, of suffering and
death, was formed the mould, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
throughout the long and dreadful years of
war the young Australian soldier has been
cast. From that day onwards, through the
fearful horrors of trench warfare in France
and Flanders, on the burning sands of the
East, on land and on sea, the armies of the
young Commonwealth, casting out not only
fear but doubt, have dared, endured, and
died, supremely confident of victory.</p>

<p>Through the long dark days when the skies
were black with omens of disaster for the
Allies, they faltered not, nor for a moment
doubted that the cause for which they fought
would triumph. Their record is a glorious
one, and its lustre is no fitful gleam, but
shines brilliantly throughout the long dread
years of trial.</p>

<p>It is of the deathless story of the Australians
before Amiens that you write, and inspired
by such a theme yours will be a story to
make the pulses of all Australians leap in
their veins with exultation.</p>

<p>When in the Spring of 1918 the great German
offensive pressed back and by force of
numbers broke through the sorely tried
British line, the Australian divisions were
hurried down from the North and rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
up to stem the German armies, flushed with
triumph and supremely confident of final
victory.</p>

<p>The story of the battles fought by the
Australians before Amiens is amongst the
most thrilling in the history of this great
world conflict. Here was the fate of civilization
decided. The great German army,
marching along the road in column of route,
reached the crest of high land overlooking
Amiens, and with but a few miles between
them and this key to Paris, were held up by
a veritable handful of Australians, later reinforced
as the rest of the Divisions came to
hand. It was the turning of the tide; the
fighting raged around Villers-Bretonneux,
but the car of the German Juggernaut rolled
forward no more. From that day the onward
rush of the enemy offensive was stayed.
An impassable barrier had been set up beyond
which the enemy could not pass. But the
young soldiers of Australia, not satisfied with
arresting his onward march, began to force
the Hun back; at first slowly, and then
faster and faster, until in the great offensive
of August 8, when along with four Divisions
of Canadians and two British, they swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
him back in headlong rout, nor gave him
pause until breaking through the vaunted
Hindenburg line they stood victorious at
Beaurevoir.</p>

<p>The deeds of these brave men will remain
for ever fresh in the minds of Australians.
Australia has reason to be proud of her war
effort; she has done great things; but she
has paid a great price. That a small community
of five millions all told should have
recruited 417,000 men and sent 330,000
twelve thousand miles across the seas, is a
great thing. The number of our dead&mdash;57,000&mdash;and
our total casualties&mdash;289,723&mdash;show
how great is the price which Australia
has paid for Liberty.</p>

<p>Although I have not seen the manuscript
of <cite>The Diggers</cite>, with such a theme it is impossible
that the author of <cite>The Children of the
Dead End</cite> and <cite>The Great Push</cite> can fail.</p>

<span class="pfs80">THE SOMME</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">In the afternoon of October 11, 1918, I found
myself with a party travelling out from
Amiens and taking the straight road that
runs eastwards towards St. Quentin across
the war harried fields of the Somme. We
had just passed through a country where the
harvest was gathered in, where the hay ricks
and cornstacks stood high round the ancient
farmhouses, and we were now in a country
where Death had reaped its sad harvest for
over four years, where all was ruin and decay&mdash;a
spread of demolition and destruction.
This was the battleground of the Somme.</p>

<p>This department is level, very fertile and
was at one time amongst the best cultivated
districts of France. Cider was made there,
poultry reared, and the locality was rich in
all manner of farm produce. And it stood
high in textile industries&mdash;wool, cotton, hemp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
silk-spinning, and the weaving of velvet and
carpets. In addition to these industries there
were also large iron foundries, beetroot sugar
factories, distilleries, breweries, employing
prior to the war close on seventy thousand
hands. But now, at the present moment, all
these industries are obliterated, the rich
pastures of the Somme are barren wastes, the
factories and distilleries huddles of charred
wood, twisted iron, and broken bricks. All
homes and hamlets are destroyed, and for
miles and miles ruin succeeds ruin, until the
eye wearies and the heart is heavy at the
sight of the horror which has been heaped on
the once fair land of France.</p>

<p>The land of the Somme is not alone deserted
and ravaged. It is dead, utterly laid waste
as if the lava of war had not alone fallen on it,
but blotted it out as a sand storm smothers
the landmarks of a desert. Of the great
trees which lined the roadways nothing
remains save the peeled stumps, that stretch
mile after mile as far as the eye can see, passive
relics of the hate which swept over them and
broke them down. Never again will they
bear a leaf or call to the dead earth for the
food which gave green to their foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The green which spreads out from the
roadways is the green of rank weeds, thistle,
nettle and dock, the rank undergrowth which
rises through the tortured strands of rusty
wire that were once the outer ramparts of the
Hindenburg line. Up from these nettles,
docks, and thistles, rises here and there a
cumbrous tank which at one time fell into a
shell-hole and was unable to hiccough itself
out again.</p>

<p>By the roadside lie shells which failed to
explode, shells in their cases which were never
despatched on their mission of death, shells
sticking nose deep in the clay with their bases
showing through the weeds. Near these are
gun emplacements with the guns still in their
original positions pointing back towards the
locality where the British troops are at
present billeted in their many rest areas.</p>

<p>Here is a mill, its walls down, a brewery
silent and deserted, a sugar refinery with its
girders twisted and bent, its framework
stripped of all covering, its iron bowels naked
to the sky.</p>

<p>It is hard to picture this spread of world
being other at any time than a wild desolate
waste, covered with broken homes, rusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
limbers and waggons, with ghastly spiked
contraptions of war, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux de frise</span>, distorted
entanglements, trip wires hidden in
the weeds, snares for unwary feet, and grotesque
ill-proportioned dug-outs, with doors
askew and roofs falling in.</p>

<p>Elbows of trench suddenly gape by the
roadside and as suddenly cease. At one time
these were parts of a well-proportioned alley,
set with fire-bay and traverse, boarded floor
and well-built parapet, running for mile after
mile in one continuous crooked line from the
steep Vosges of the South to the sand dunes
of the North. Here was a sap that once
stretched across No Man's Land, there was a
front line, and further back, crawling through
holt and hamlet, all that remained of a
communication trench could be dimly discerned.
The hamlet was now a medley of
tortured beams and fallen bricks, the holt a
congregation of peeled stumps that in the
distance looked like an assemblage of lepers,
and sap, fire-bay and communication trench
were defaced, disfigured, their shapeless ruin
adding to the ravage which had deformed the
face of the country.</p>

<p>In imagination I could picture the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in days of peace with its rich pastures and
fields of corn, its long roads lined with rows of
magnificent trees, its hedgerows, dykes and
canals, its populous villages where the bells
of eventide called the faithful to prayer.
This and much more could be pictured, the
snug farmhouses, with their ricks of hay, the
red-tiled cottages, the merry cafés, the shrines
by the roadside, the windmills circling to the
breeze, the old men smoking their long-shanked
pipes, the women, bravely arrayed in
mutch caps and white aprons, carrying on
the work of their household, the children
playing.... Where were the children now?</p>

<p>Even as I thought of this I could picture
a date not so very far back, the winter of
1916-17, the most trying winter of the war.
Here in this battle-wracked region the Australians
were up against it. And "up against
it" means everything, from the shattering
on the parados of the mail bag with a letter
from home, to the horrible death as men
were sucked inch by inch into the rising mud
of a slushy trench, sinking down into a grave
where every effort to get clear was futile and
where the tomb, cold, clammy and slimy,
rose up to engulf the helpless victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The endless, ghastly horror of that winter
will never be forgotten by those who lived
through it. Two things are impossible: one,
the forgetting of that Somme winter by those
who knew it; and the other, the inability to
picture the life of the trenches by those who
have never fought in them.</p>

<p>Take the case of the young soldier suddenly
dumped into the trench of war. Let the man
be a sundowner from far back, where life is
hard, in the Australian scrubs, or let him be a
clerk from some shop or office in Sydney or
Melbourne. For both, the life that they had
formerly known was comparatively comfortable
when placed in contrast to the life which
Europe offered them when they came there
as soldiers. One came from the parched
Paroo, the other from the Sydney shop;
both donned the habiliments of war and after
a certain period of training found themselves
stuck in a stinking drain on the Continent of
Europe. This drain was the trench, with a
fire-bay that was a miniature lagoon, the
fire-step covered with slush, the parapet and
parados falling in as if they were ditches built
of wet sand. Water was there, water mixed
with litter and clay. It was impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
lie down, for the slush rose over the body,
finding its way into eyes, mouth and ear.
When the men slept they slept standing, to
find when they awoke that it was almost
impossible to move hand or foot. They
simply stuck there and had to be hauled out
by their mates. No fires were allowed to be
lit, for the position had to be kept hidden
from the enemy. Even if fires were allowed,
there was no fuel, no coke, no wood and no
matches.</p>

<p>And it was constantly raining or snowing,
filling the alleys of war with slush and slime.
In addition to the rain which winter brought,
there was the eternal rain of scrap-iron sent
across from the enemy gun emplacements.
If a man was wounded he had to lie in the
trench all day, for the sniper was always on
the wait for the men engaged in the task of
helping their stricken brothers. To move
through the trench with a weighty stretcher
was impossible.</p>

<p>At night, when the darkness covered the
battle-area, the stretcher-bearers crossed the
parados and carried the wounded back to the
dressing station, their way beset with danger,
bursting shells, hidden holes, and the trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
wire that littered the terrible fields. And the
mud rose to the men's knees, threatening to
drag them down into its clammy depths.
But despite this, the great work of war, the
deeds of mercy and endurance, were carried
on by the brave soldiery who had come so
far to fight, not for the glory of their Empire
so much as for the freedom of the world.</p>

<p>The dangers which beset the men going out
also beset the men coming in. Ration parties
were sent to bring in food to the trench garrison,
but dangers being many and the way
difficult, all food was cold when it arrived.
Often it never came to hand at all, and those
sent for it never returned to report themselves
to the battalion. They left, the men of the
ration party, with steaming dixies of tea, so
the head-cook in some broken-down house at
the rear, reported. "But they never reached
here," said the battalion orderly sergeant in
the front line. And somewhere in the semi-liquid
mud that stretched from the field
kitchen to the trench, the ration party disappeared
from the sight of their mates for ever.</p>

<p>Then, after long days of hardship and nights
of waiting (how many days and nights had
passed they knew not), the men who garri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>soned
the front line were relieved and went
back to support trenches for a rest. Here
they would sit in a trench as wet as the trench
which they had left, sleep in a shelter which
hid the sky from their eyes but never kept
the rain away from their sodden clothes.
But despite this the trench had some advantages
denied to the men nearer No Man's
Land. They could light a fire and cook
meals, make tea and fry a rasher of bacon.
But the wood to make the fire was seldom to
be obtained, and when it came to hand it was
too wet to burn. Still, their own efforts to
make their stay in support comfortable, helped
a little to relieve the tedium of the time.
The rest came to an end at the close of three
or four days, and back again they went to
the front line trenches.</p>

<p>Away home in England or in the Colonies
of that Kingdom live men and women who,
despite reading, report and record, cannot
picture the life which was lived by these men.
The limit of suffering overpassed, nothing
but their imperturbable endurance nerved
them to the work which was theirs. For
those who live so far away, the sight of these
trenches even at a distance would raise a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
feeling of discomfort, to walk through these
lines of mud would cause them no end of
torture, mental and physical, to stay there
for a day would be horrible, but to fight there
in rain and snow and shell fire would be
superlative in its ghastliness. Yet far away
from these scenes, removed from all the agony
war entails, it has been reported of some that
they calmly sit down in their comfortable
rooms and with smug pens and righteous
speech protest against the little tot of rum
which is issued now and again to the gallant
soldiers who stand against the enemy, guarding
the Empire which that enemy has set out
to assail. Heaven send that this war waged
against the foe without may help a little to
cripple the smug intolerance that dwells
within!</p>

<p>It was through the beaten land, on the road
that runs from Amiens to Peronne that our
car sped. Scarcely a soul was in sight,
though now and again we could see refugees
returning to the homes which once were theirs.
We passed a woman and two children, the
former dressed very neatly, with a mutch cap
on her head and an umbrella under her arm.
A mother and her loved ones, probably going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
back to the home they had known in days of
peace.</p>

<p>A few miles out from Amiens we saw an old
man ambling painfully along in front of us,
now and again coming to a halt and looking
round him, taking stock of the country
through which he was passing. Hearing the
car following him he turned and looked at us.
He was a very old man, his beard white; he
carried a stick in his hand and held a bundle
under his arm. As the car came close to him
it stopped and the driver inquired of the man
where he was going.</p>

<p>"To Villars-Carbonnel," said the man,
putting his stick under the arm that held the
bundle, and rubbing his whiskers with the
free hand.</p>

<p>"Your own village?" asked the driver.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Come inside and I'll drive you there,"
said the driver.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said the man. "I
prefer to walk. I'm near there. Villars-Carbonnel
is round the corner."</p>

<p>The car drove on, and my thoughts dwelt
with the man who was going to Villars-Carbonnel
and who preferred to walk there. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
viewing the countryside from the road he
probably wanted to see all that had happened
to the place since he was there before. Or
perhaps he wanted to prolong the joyful
anticipation of the homecoming. With the
remembrance common to the old he was no
doubt calling to mind the village which he
had known all his life, the people whom he
had known and loved when he dwelt there.
What would the village be like now? Would
it be broken down like the other villages which
he had passed on the road, Villers-Bretonneux,
Warfusse Abancourt, and Lamotte-en-Santerre?
These were twisted out of all shape,
their cafés in ruins, their streets piled with
rubble, the roof beams of their many homes
burned, and churches beaten almost to the
ground. But no, his native village would not
have suffered as these had suffered! He loved
it so much that the thought of irreparable
ruin hanging over his own birthplace could
not certainly have entered his mind. Let
him have his dreams of homecoming and he
was happy.</p>

<p>I could picture that old man in days before
the war sitting in front of his house in the
summer evenings with the vines trailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
round the front door and the apple blossoms
blooming in his garden. In the distance the
mists crept up from the Somme, the village
girls leading the cattle in from the pastures
came down the street; the children played on
the pavement, making the night glad with
their innocent prattle. Possibly the church
bell was then ringing out the Angelus, calling
the devotees to worship, while the old man
sat there smoking his long-shanked pipe with
the tobacco piled high over the bowl and the
gleaming threads falling down on the breast
of his coat. Then, after a while, he might go
into a café, drink his glass of red wine and
play a game of draughts or dominoes with his
neighbour. And he knew the village, knew
every man and woman there. It was his
native place, loved as only the French can
love the spot of earth on which they were
born, and known to him as a painter knows
every tint of colour on the picture which he
has completed.</p>

<p>We came to a cross-road and here for a
moment the driver stopped to look at his
map. Round us the country stretched for
miles, with here and there a ruined village
or farmhouse breaking the landscape. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
us the road was a dun colour, showing that
broken bricks had been used in the fashioning
of the highway. Thistles grew by the roadside
and through these could be seen many
strands of rusted wire, with here and there a
cross turning green with the rain and topped
with a trench helmet or khaki cap. Flowers
grew there, late flowers nodding gravely in
the breeze. Not a house was to be seen, not
even the ruins of a wall. Above this was a
board with something written on it, and leaning
over the car I could read the message.
This was what it told me:</p>

<span class="pfs80">VILLERS-BRETONNEUX</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">Broken walls, littered streets, charred
roof-beams rising in tortured disarray
over the piles of red brick rubbish,
stumps of trees, rusty entanglements, battered
barricades, pitted pavements, disbanded
vehicles and derelict guns. This is Villers-Bretonneux,
the village from which the
Australians drove the Germans on the night
of April 24-25. The story of the attack, of
which we have read so many accounts, was
again told to me by an officer as we stopped
for a while in the village to see the ground over
which the men of the South proved their
worth in what we hope will be the last battle
of the Somme.</p>

<p>Amiens is the last fringe of civilization.
Beyond that we come into the dead world
which was over-run by the German hordes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the summer of 1918. In the late days of
August when the battle lines were penetrated
by them an approach to open warfare was
reached. Endless streams of infantry in
field grey streaked through and over the
British defences and pushed forward behind
light machine guns which now not alone
covered the advance from the rear, but
opened up a path by working from the front
of the attacking soldiery. Under such protection
the Germans dribbled through, taking
all available shelter, fighting from behind
clumps of trees and broken walls, firing from
folds in the earth and newly formed shell-holes
and driving the men in khaki in front
of them. But Villers-Bretonneux, like a
mighty rock, withstood the invasion of the
war storm and here it broke itself against the
barrier of flesh and blood which was Britain
in arms.</p>

<p>The Germans trying to hammer their way
through to Amiens were stopped here, but,
determined to get through, they started a
heavy bombardment which lasted for four
hours and in which a lavish supply of gas,
lachrymose, chlorine and mustard, was used.
German tanks, high turreted and gigantic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
figured in this attack for the first time. The
battle fine extended from Villers-Bretonneux
in the north to Hangard in the south, and five
whole German divisions and some units from
a sixth were engaged in the exploit. In this
attack the Boche pushed the British back to
the village of Cachy and on to the fringe of
Bois l'Abbé. This was the position held on
the evening of April 24. Villers-Bretonneux
was in German hands, but only as Pompeii
was in the hands of the Romans when Vesuvius
was flooding the fated streets with
streams of molten lava.</p>

<p>It was at night that the Australians came
on to the scene of conflict, two brigades, one
from the Fourth and one from the Fifth
Australian Division attacking. They had
marched up to their allotted positions, but
neither brigade had before seen the ground
which they were going to attack.</p>

<p>The night was one never to be forgotten,
with its battle fights flaring far ahead, and
the roads back from the fighting line crowded
with refugees hurrying away from their
devastated villages, their quiet farms and
their burning homes. Old men who had not
left their native place for the past twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
years, came along the roads, leading little
ponies, frightened cows, or some other animals
which belong to the stock of a well-tended
farm.</p>

<p>Women, old and young, were on the road,
carrying their children away from the horrible
holocaust of war. Little boys and girls,
wild-eyed and terrified, plodded along through
the press on the roads, not knowing where
they were going, but filled with one thought&mdash;to
be out of it, to hide in some humble shelter
far from the ravages of the terrible Boche.
Mothers wept and ran backwards and forwards
through the throng of moving figures,
calling for petit Jean or petite Yvette. But
the little children were lost, swallowed up in
the vortex of the terrible night.</p>

<p>What was happening? What was going
to happen? Nobody knew. Only one thing
was certain. The Boche was at the throat of
France, putting the country to the sword,
burning the churches, trampling down the
little homes of the simple people. Flying
from the menace of the night as children
would fly from a nursery in which a gorilla
was loosened, the poor people were on the
road hurrying away from the village of Villers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>-Bretonneux,
from the town of Amiens, from
the fated corners of France on which the
German was pouring his hate.</p>

<p>And through this stream of sufferers the
Australians, with eyes afire and teeth hard
set, made their way eastwards. That night,
above any other night, they wanted to fight,
to get at the foe and send him reeling back
towards the line from which he came.</p>

<p>On this night, the 24th, the Australians
attacked, driving the enemy back into Villers-Bretonneux.
The struggle was a fierce one
in the dim moonlight and costly to the enemy,
who disputed the ground step by step with
bayonet and bomb, through the dark streets
lit up by the flash of explosions, and ghastly
with the shrieks of the wounded and dying.
The area of battle was heavy with the gas
which had been thrown into the town in the
earlier part of the day and was still filling
shell-hole, creek and cranny.</p>

<p>Neither side dared to shell the place, as the
artillery of both friend and enemy were
unaware what part of the village was occupied
by their own troops. And so, unaccompanied
by the roar of guns, the grim struggle went on
in the darkness, the Germans filled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lust of dominance, and the Australians
nerved by the sad sights which they had seen
on the road of sorrow that led from Amiens
to the country in the rear.</p>

<p>Dawn saw the village cleared of the enemy
and saw, too, the dead lying in heaps on the
pavement and gutters. Australians who lived
through that night are of opinion that never
yet has the bayonet found so many victims
in one fight. And never was a battle so fierce.
The Peninsula was terrible, Pozieres horrible,
Polygon ghastly, but Villers-Bretonneux was
sheer, undiluted hell.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER III</a><br /><br />

<span class="pfs80">TOWARDS PERONNE</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">We passed through Lamotte-en-Santerre,
a village in complete ruin
like all other villages on the
road eastwards from Amiens. The road to
Hamel branches off here, and we were shown
the place from a distance, Hamel, where the
Australians fought side by side with the
Americans and came to know the worth
of the New Allies which had entered the war.</p>

<p>The Australians often speak of the Americans.
The former are very proud of the
fact that the Yankees on their first attack
were attached to the Diggers, and the soldiers
of both countries fought shoulder to shoulder
in the fight for Hamel. This was on the
fourth of July, "some Fourth," as the Americans
say. The Americans lived among the
Australians for some days, and in that short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
space of time they came to know them as
if they were their own countrymen.</p>

<p>When the attack was on the Americans
fought splendidly. Merged in the larger
Australian command and vieing with the
war-hardened Diggers in the stress and dash
of the conflict they went forward as if for
a race, determined to stick through it in
thick and thin and not let their new friends
down. Prior to the attack the officer in
command of the Americans told them that
they were going into action with some of
the world's best fighting men, that it was an
honour to battle in such company and they
must show themselves worthy of it, for the
credit of the United States was in their
keeping.</p>

<p>In the fighting that ensued they showed
themselves worthy of their new mates,
attempted feats almost impossible and accomplished
superhuman deeds. The Australians
are loud in their admiration of the Americans
and consider the Yankees as soldiers of muscle
and mettle second to none.</p>

<p>In the Hamel attack they were not to be
held back, and that their casualties were
heavy in the fighting was to a great measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
due to the Yankees' hurry to get forward,
and rush ahead under the shells of their
own barrage to get on the neck of the enemy.</p>

<p>The tanks helped greatly in this operation,
and even now, in a time when the great
events of the morning are so often forgotten
in the greater events of the night, the Australians
still speak with enthusiasm of the
work done by the steeled mastodons of war
in the attack on Hamel.</p>

<p>Germans surrendered readily in most
places here, but at one or two points nests
of machine guns evaded the vigilance of the
tanks and kept up a harrowing fire on the
attackers. It was a case then of rushing
the positions with the bayonet, and the
Australians went forward in their grand,
audacious manner, fighting every yard of
the way. The still bodies lying on the field
afterwards testified to the struggle which
had taken place. And the Americans proved
their worth, fighting in such a manner that
the Australians were quick to regard them
with admiration and look upon them as great
soldiers.</p>

<p>"Great fighters, but damned bad moppers-up!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>This, in one terse sentence, was an Australian
soldier's opinion of the American
soldiery. This Australian was a man who
had fought side by side with Americans, and
who gloried in the fact. He had seen them
dash forward at Hamel when that part of
the Western Front was captured; he had
joined them in the affair, and was proud to
fight alongside of them. He had also taken
part in the fighting north of St. Quentin
when the American troops went forth at
the tail of a mighty barrage to attack the
Hindenburg line.</p>

<p>The "Diggers" have a great fellow-feeling
for the "Doughboys," whom they consider
to be very much like themselves in thought
and outlook. The Diggers, having fought
with their splendid American comrades,
dared the tremendous task of war under
the same barrage and shared the same risks
and dangers on the field, have come to know
the new Ally, and that knowledge is filled
with appreciation.</p>

<p>The Americans are great fighters, they
will tell you, and add as an afterthought
that they are "bad moppers-up."</p>

<p>"Mopping-up" is practically a new opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>tion
in battle, and if not altogether new it
has come into great prominence in this war,
especially when the enemy is retreating.
The track of the flying Boche is a track of
snares, pitfalls, toils, traps, hidden mines
and all manner of treacherous contrivances
which a cunning enemy can lay to kill his
pursuers. The dug-out may conceal a
machine gun, the apparently dead may be
waiting for a chance to fire at the troops
which have passed him by, the elbow of
trench may conceal a sniper, so all suspicious
objects have to be examined before being
crossed over.</p>

<p>But the Americans, I understand, don't
waste time in dealing with little affairs like
these. Full of the call of battle they rush
forward to get right into the thick of the
struggle. Their business is in front where
the fighting is hardest, and they do not
care to linger in dug-outs and trenches apparently
disbanded and deserted.</p>

<p>"They're bad moppers-up," the Australian
repeated. "But they're great fighters, these
Yanks."</p>

<p>It was in this district near Hamel that
heavy fighting took place last summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
when the grass and self-sown crops stood
high on the field of battle. Here the Australians
adopted a certain kind of guerilla
warfare, which kept the Germans in continual
suspense and which greatly helped the forward
penetration of the attackers. For
certain periods no direct frontal attack was
opened in force, but during the time the
Diggers did not remain inactive. Patrols
stole out through the long grass, crawling
to certain localities occupied by the Boche,
sunken roads, valleys, shell-holes and ruins of
farmhouses. Here at various points were
many encounters in which bomb and bayonet
were used and in this way many nests were
cleared of the enemy. Platoons and squads
adopted these tactics on their own bent,
stealing ground bit by bit from the Germans.
Even solitary soldiers, working on their
own initiative, did a lot towards chasing the
enemy back. Stories of deeds accomplished
by Diggers, the capturing of dug-outs, the
rushing of machine-gun positions are spoken
of, but as the Australian is one of the most
modest of men, many stories of desperate
deeds and high enterprise will never be known
beyond the limits of camp and the field of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>At various points along the route the officer
conducting our party told us of various
incidents, comic and sublime, which had
taken place on the wide field of the Somme.
Here it was the story of a one-armed Captain
who went into an attack at the head of his
platoon, carrying only a walking stick.
Leading his men on the tail of a barrage
and holding them back when they pressed
too close to the bursting shells, he regulated
the line with his stick like the conductor
of an orchestra.</p>

<p>Again it was the story of a machine gun,
untouched by the barrage, resuming firing
when the first wave of Australian attackers
almost reached it. A machine gun is a
vicious little weapon, and the Australians
had to fling themselves flat to avoid being
cut to pieces. Then three men, a sergeant,
a corporal and a private, rushed the gun
from the flank, bayoneted the gunners and
captured the gun. This prompt manœuvre,
planned and executed in the space of time
necessary for the lighting of a cigarette,
saved many lives.</p>

<p>Another story was of a crew of desperate
Germans who brought a machine gun into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the open and fired through the barrage on
the Diggers. The Australians saw the gun,
and a company commander without a
moment's hesitation turned to two of his
sergeants and put the trite question: "Are
you game?" The sergeants, who were
game, nodded, and without further ado the
three men rushed through the bursting
shells on the gun. Bullets hissed past their
ears, flying shrapnel splinters wounded them,
but with impetuous dash and sublime indifference
to death they swept on the gun crew
and destroyed it. Later one of the sergeants
died of his wounds; the officer, with his
shoulder badly torn, continued to lead his
men and stayed with them all the next day
through a heavy bombardment.</p>

<p>Again we were told of a private, whose
crime sheet spoke of innumerable petty
delinquencies. This man, when his platoon
officer became a casualty and the non-commissioned
officers fell, led the way to a trench
where the Germans were stoutly resisting,
and with bomb and bayonet drove the Germans
back. Hand-to-hand fighting of the
stiffest nature took place, and this private
killed at least twenty-five of the enemy before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
they were routed. Having accomplished
this herculean task he led the Diggers to
the objective line, organized and took charge
of it for the two days following.</p>

<p>Then there are many other stories of men,
eager and exultant at the prospect of making
an attack and getting into grips with the
enemy. There was a certain private who
had been detailed for a soft job at the baths
in the back area. On hearing that his battalion
was going to attack he absented himself
from his post without leave, joined his
regiment and took part in the attack. Another
man, a corporal of the same battalion,
was away at some training school, did the
same, but by ill-luck he arrived late and
joined his men the day after the battle.</p>

<p>"On the day when we attacked on that
ridge across there an officer of the infantry
came in an aeroplane to take part in the
attack," said the driver of the car when we
came to a momentary stop on the St. Quentin
road. He pointed his finger towards a bluff
that rose from the Somme and stood a little
higher than the country round it. "He
was an officer, hit on the head by a splinter
of shell a few days before the attack, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
sent to hospital at the base," said the driver.
"Word that his battalion was going to cross
the bags reached him, and he implored permission
to return, as his wound was healed.
But the doctors wouldn't allow him to go.
On being told this he went to a mate of his,
an airman who was flying towards the front,
and asked for a lift. He was given a lift,
and got in touch with his battalion in time
to get into the attack."</p>

<p>Isolated incidents like these show the
temper of the men, their desire to be in the
midst of the fighting, the devotion and
enthusiasm of soldiers who have crossed
miles of sea to do their bit in the great war
which has tortured Europe for so many years.
Of her record in the war Australia may well
be proud.</p>

<span class="pfs80">MONT ST. QUENTIN</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">It was on the bank of the Somme Canal
in the early morning, Peronne in the
distance, and a light railway track at our
feet. The place was Brie. We had arrived
there the previous night.</p>

<p>The railway track was torn and twisted,
rails sticking into the air at oblique angles,
sleepers charred, chairs smashed, the bed of
the four-foot way churned and broken, with
the waggons and trucks which once ran along
them smashed to fragments, thrown hither
and thither, out into the canal on the right or
into the fields on the left side of the line.
Looking at the riverscape one could see in the
near distance a broken bridge with the sluggish
water rippling lazily round the buttresses
which yet remained, and near at hand, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the day was chilly, three naked soldiers stood
on a boat making ready to dive into the oily
water.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Somme canal was
a spread of marshland on which could be seen
lines of duckboards running hither and thither,
round pools and clumps of osiers, but all going
in the same direction, towards the town of
Peronne. It was on August 29 that the
German rearguards were driven back across
this portion of the Somme. British troops
then seized several crossings of the canal in
this locality, but the marshes beyond being
impassable it was found impracticable to
cross and seize Peronne.</p>

<p>It was therefore decided to turn the Somme
barrier by an attack from the north, and to do
this entailed seizing the steep promontory
of Mont St. Quentin. It was from the north
across a thousand yards of level pasture land
pitted with shell holes and criss-crossed with
trenches and lines of wire entanglements that
the Australians made a famous advance,
fighting all the way and seizing Mont St.
Quentin. The task was a herculean one,
adding undying glory to the men who accomplished
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Our party was allowed to visit Mont St.
Quentin and standing on its summit I saw the
field across which the Australians made their
advance. Looking from a German observation
post on the promontory I could see the
green field, smooth as the cover of a book,
lying in front of me. Nothing could escape
a vigilant eye on its broad expanse. Shorn
of grass a rabbit could be seen if it crawled
across the levels. It was here that the German
machine gunners had their nests, and
it was here that an observation post sunk
into the rock gave a complete field of observation
to the watcher. The post was cunningly
made with a ladder leading down a shaft ten
feet in depth. At the bottom was a field
telephone with wires running back to battalion
headquarters. All that the observer
had to do was to clamber up the ladder, take
stock of the field in front, go back again and
'phone his report to headquarters in Peronne.</p>

<p>The town, although of little industrial
import, has a history dating back to the days
of Clovis II. It is the burial-place of Charles
the Simple, who died of starvation in a dungeon
in the castle of Peronne, which castle was
also the prison of Louis XI for some time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
But the castle is now no more, the Germans
have slashed it to pieces. The church of St.
Jean, built in 1509, is also ground to dust. In
1870 it was greatly damaged by the Boche
when he laid siege to the place, but it was
restored afterwards. Now, however, it is
beyond restoration.</p>

<p>A famous incident was still, prior to this
war, celebrated by the natives of Peronne.
The town was once besieged by Charles V, and
a woman named Marie Fouré greatly distinguished
herself in the defence of the place.
After a period of stiff fighting the siege was
raised and Charles V departed. The anniversary
of the raising of the siege was, until
1914, annually celebrated by the inhabitants,
and offerings were laid at the feet of Marie
Fouré, whose statue stood in the town. But
now the statue, like the Castle of Peronne and
the church of St. Jean, is no more.</p>

<p>The present war, however, has given something
to replace the memory of Marie Fouré.
Outside the town at the foot of Mont St.
Quentin can be seen a tract of ground set
apart as a site for the memorial which is to
be raised to the second Australian Division
in commemoration of the men who fought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
died for a great cause under the ramparts of
Peronne. And in the days to come it is
probable that once a year, on August 31, the
townsfolk will repair thither and lay garlands
of flowers at the base of the memorial that
will remind them of the brave boys who fought
and died for the freedom of France and for a
yet greater freedom&mdash;the freedom of the
world.</p>

<p>The capture of Mont St. Quentin was an
operation second to none in the great summer
drive of 1918. This natural fortress, strong
as any on the Western Front, stands high
over the Somme marshland and dominates
all the surrounding country. On its south-eastern
slope is a dense wood, now stumped
and shivered, but at that time its trees stood
high and green, burdened with a dense
foliage that made it a splendid hiding-place
for machine-gun nests. Though at that time
the Germans were falling back at several
points of the line it was unbelievable that
they would give up Mont St. Quentin, a point
of the utmost strategical value, as key to the
whole Peronne area, without a bitter struggle.</p>

<p>That they prepared themselves to hold it
is shown by the fact that the place was garri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>soned
by a force of 1500 men, and after the
battle captured Germans stated that they
specially volunteered to hold the line against
an Australian advance.</p>

<p>On August 29, at noon, the British held all
the southern banks of the Somme, but the
Australians, fired with a long chain of victories,
decided to advance further. Up till
then in the Somme fighting they had recovered
over 125 square miles of country and forty
villages. Fifteen thousand prisoners had
fallen to them, 301 officers, two regimental
commanders, five battalion commanders and
staffs, 161 guns, 3,000 machine guns, the
whole transport of one battalion and miles
of light railway trackage.</p>

<p>On the night of August 29, when darkness
fell the Australian engineers busied themselves
throwing bridges across the Somme
canal, south of Peronne, and some of these
bridges, broken and battered, are to be seen
there yet. Working hard in the gloom,
despite the continuous rifle and machine
gun fire of the enemy, the engineers completed
their task, and in the morning of the
30th patrols essayed to cross the canal and
advance through the marshes towards Peronne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
No practicable path could be found across
the swampy morass; the enemy kept up a
stubborn resistance and the Diggers had to
desist from attempting further headway at
the moment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, fighting was proceeding elsewhere,
and at every point the Australians were
making gradual headway towards the ancient
town. In the forenoon of August 30 the
Omiecourt peninsula east of the village of
Clery had been cleared and a bridge head held
by the Germans was taken. This opening a
route to the town, it was decided to advance
in this direction and lay siege to Mont St.
Quentin, attacking it from the north and
west instead of the south.</p>

<p>By three o'clock in the afternoon the
Australians came into contact with the German
advanced positions and fierce hand-to-hand
fighting took place and continued far
into the night. Every inch of the ground was
disputed, every path, every gully and bank
became the scene of desperate fighting.
Brave men went forth to meet death calmly
and proudly, doing their duty with the consciousness
of Right to sustain them, enduring
all the risks of the night with a grim fortitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and bearing all its discomforts as if they loved
war solely for its own sake.</p>

<p>But it is too much to say that the men love
war. No man of normal pattern loves war as
it is fought here, hip deep in slush all through
the day and night in an atmosphere suffocating
and gaseous. If a man loves war, he is no
more to be complimented on fighting than a
man who loves a good dish is to be complimented
on eating. But one thing is true.
The Australians, certain of the cause for
which they are fighting, are keen on keeping
at it until a successful finish is reached, knowing
that the German method of warfare,
waged with all its attendant despotism and
tyranny, has for its aim, not alone the breaking
of the Allies, but the shattering of the
moral frontier of civilization. The Australians
are out, not so much to make war for
its own sake as to wage it for something that
is straight and clean. And never was this
purpose made more manifest than at the
taking of Mont St. Quentin.</p>

<p>In the early morning of August 31, the
infantry from New South Wales, Victoria and
Tasmania, got orders to attack. The men
were then in the locality of Clery-sur-Somme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and by a strange coincidence rations came to
hand just as the attack was about to start.
The mail also arrived with letters and parcels
from home, but war cannot stop for matters
of such little import as the reading of letters
and the filling of hungry stomachs. Leaving
the hot steaming dixies of tea behind them and
stuffing their letters in their pockets the
Australians in the cold damp morning, unaided
by tanks or barrage, set out to attack.
Peronne was in flames, Mont St. Quentin was
impregnable, the Germans were offering a
stubborn resistance. But no faltering for
the "Diggers" when they were "up against
it"!</p>

<p>The day cleared as they swept out from
Clery-sur-Somme and made their way across
the level stretch of land that lies between that
village and their objective, fighting all the
road and clearing the enemy from the old
Somme trenches which lined the way. And
as they fought they could see a hillock in the
distance standing blank and bald, and to all
seeming, impregnable. This was the steep
promontory of Mont St. Quentin, the summit
of which the brave soldiers of the New South
Wales Brigade had to take. And to-day it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
presented a most formidable appearance and
inaccessible front. But the men knew no
stay, they prepared their hearts for a sublime
suicide. Letters as yet unread were taken
from their pockets, torn to shreds and flung
to the winds. Though confronted with an
almost certain death they were not going to
give any information to the enemy.</p>

<p>Wire entanglements unbroken by shell-fire
blocked the way of the soldiers of New South
Wales, but undaunted, they sought for openings
and wormed their way through. Some
took off their coats, their packs, lifted props
and sandbags that lay by the way, threw
these on the wires and clambered over. The
promontory was stormed, the ready bayonet
brought into play and the enemy was cleared
off Mont St. Quentin. At this one swift
assault they scooped in most of the whole
German rearguard north of Peronne, and
captured the great natural position overlooking
the city and took 1,500 prisoners.</p>

<p>It was here that 250 Australians captured
800 Germans, big soldiers of the Prussian
Guards. In addition to the men the colonel
of the battalion was taken prisoner, an irate
individual who was exceedingly annoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
because the Australians had dared to capture
him or his men. Bristling with arrogance he
blustered and swore at the Australian officer
who questioned him. How dared the Australians,
the common Australian soldier, order him
about, prod him with a bayonet when he
refused to move and catch him by the collar
of his coat and shove him in front of them
towards the cages in the back area. He was
a colonel, a scion of a noble house, an aristocrat.</p>

<p>"If you don't behave yourself," said the
officer, "I'll pass you on to the Diggers. At
the present moment you're not with the slaves
in Germany."</p>

<p>The Colonel blazed into another round of
abuse, and the officer, losing his temper, handed
the Colonel over to the Diggers, giving them
orders to search the man.</p>

<p>And they searched him, thrust miry hands
into his pockets, felt under his shirt to see if
he had any papers on his person. This
amused the men, but did in no way ease
the temper of the Prussian aristocrat and
tyrant.</p>

<span class="pfs80">THE HINDENBURG TUNNEL</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">On the day following our visit to Peronne
we motored out to Bellicourt to see
the Hindenburg tunnel, of which
rumour and reading tell us so much. This
tunnel was built by Hindenburg, we are told,
and if ever the British troops crossed the
German defences the enemy soldiers would
conceal themselves in thousands, come out
when our men had passed by, attack them in
rear and cut them to pieces. The Hindenburg
trenches might be crossed, but the
Hindenburg tunnel would be the ruin of the
Allies. This and that we were told, for war
quickening the ear for rumour we believe
much that in days of peace would pass by
for idle tales.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that this tunnel
was not built by Hindenburg but by Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
XVI, at whose expense the work was begun,
the cost of the undertaking being about
£4,000,000, and through it runs the great
canal of Picardy. This canal passing from
St. Quentin to Cambrai had to run through
a country rising so much that it was necessary
to carry it under the earth for a considerable
depth, and this canal tunnel in places is hewn
entirely from rock chalk. The work was
completed by Napoleon I in 1810 and a
communication opened thereby between the
river Scheldt and the extreme eastern departments
of France and the Atlantic through the
rivers Somme, Seine and Loire.</p>

<p>At Bellicourt we descended several steps
covered with mud and littered with the
wreckage of war, strands of barbed wire,
rusty rifles, German equipments, ammunition
boxes, trench helmets, sandbags, etc., all the
odds and ends flung away by the German
army in retreat.</p>

<p>Sticking through the arched entrance of
the tunnel was the prow of a flat-bottomed
barge and built over this was a chamber. In
here we made our way, crawling up long,
crooked stone stairs steeped in gloom almost
impenetrable. We entered an apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
dimly lit by an opening which let in a pale ray
of light. The officer conducting our party lit
a candle and we could see the room. Under
our feet was a floor of boards holed in many
places; some of the holes were very large.
To come along the floor without a light was
impossible, and one false step and a man would
drop through the aperture into the canal
below. On our left as we entered stood a
large wheel which was at one time worked by
a hand windlass. This wheel was used in
lifting the sluice gates to let the freight barges
through.</p>

<p>Further along were two large coppers filled
with some thick fluid which exhaled a putrid
stench. One of these coppers is now known
to history, for rumour has it that when the
British soldiers took the place they found a
German dead and naked in the boiler, that
the soldier had been dissected by a surgeon,
that the oven was at that time in use for
cooking meat for the German soldiery, etc.</p>

<p>That Germans lived there and made the
place their dwelling is true, for even now in
apartments leading off from the entrance
chamber can be seen many beds bedded with
straw and still covered with army blankets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Belts for machine gun bullets litter the
floor, and opposite an opening that looks out
towards the north-west is to be seen an emplacement
on which a machine gun once
stood. The fact is that the apartment was
used by a machine-gun crew who made the
chamber their home, who lived there, sleeping
in the place and cooking their food in the
copper.</p>

<p>Up above the machine-gun emplacement is
to be seen a hole slanting obliquely through
the outer wall and coming to an end in the
roof of the room. It is now held by some that
a shell came through here, dropped in the
midst of the gunners, burst and blew one of
the men into the copper. Of the remainder
a number were killed and two or three
wounded. On the wall of the apartment
can be seen many holes and dents made by
flying fragments.</p>

<p>This is the opinion of some. Others say
that soldiers attacked the place, ascended the
stairs, bombed the inmates of the keep, killing
many, and the force of an exploding bomb
blew one into the copper.</p>

<p>Then there is a third party, which says that
the Germans were going to use the dead man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for food. This being a most improbable
story is one of the most readily believed by the
public.</p>

<p>On leaving the canal bank and clambering
up the stairs we were able to see on left and
right the trench systems built by the Germans,
the massive parapets, the long communication
trenches, the emplacements for guns,
the pill-boxes and the rows of barbed wire
entanglement. How this place was stormed
and taken by the British soldiery is a miracle.
How they managed to lacerate the German
sinews of defence, to hack their way through
and batter down the lines erected by Hindenburg
is one of the marvels of war.</p>

<p>The story can never be told. Historians
will arise one day and tell how the infantry
advanced taking so many kilometres of ground
despite great opposition and formidable defence.
At dawn they left the village of A&mdash;&mdash;,
the historian will tell us, and at dusk they
captured the hamlet of B&mdash;&mdash;. But that will
never make the whole story of the operations
manifest to the eyes of men. Even knowing
the place on which the battle was fought,
knowing it as it is now with the trenches still
remaining and the lines of wire entanglements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
still standing, it is impossible to tell the story
of the encounter. Little details, incidents
which meant life or death to one, two or a
dozen men, the taking of a dug-out, the capture
of a machine-gun emplacement, the
scramble across the broken wire on the trail
of a tank, the hand-to-hand fight in a dark
cellar are forgotten, even by those who have
taken part in them. Only the principal outlines
and outstanding features of the gigantic
contest can be portrayed by the historian.
Little personal affairs, stories of squads and
crews, belong, as Napoleon once remarked,
"rather to the biography of the regiments
than to the history of the Army." And the
exploits of small bodies of men, of infantry
squads, of machine-gun crews will live for a
little while only when veterans of the war
exchange confidences over a backyard fence
in days of peace and when they fight their
battles over again, tracing with their pipe
shanks on their hands the lines of trench
taken and held, the redoubt lost, the ground
on which the hand-to-hand conflict took place
and all other various little doings which were
part and parcel of the greater battle.</p>

<p>The historian will give the mere outlines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the struggle. In four lines of cold print
he shall tell how &mdash;&mdash; Regiment left the village
of A&mdash;&mdash; at dawn and in face of almost
insurmountable difficulties took the hamlet
of B&mdash;&mdash; at dusk. Here the regimental
historian may come in and add a little, telling
how "B" company was held up by the
wires, how "A" company with reckless dash,
came to the assistance of their mates, how
Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; urged the men forward, how
no one faltered, how, with set teeth, they set
themselves to the task of getting through and
how in the end victory was gained. But
still there is a lot more to be told, the pining
and waiting of the women left at home, the
sleepless nights when letters from the loved
ones have not come to hand, the weary
misery of mothers who have lost their sons,
of wives who have lost their husbands. In
this story of war there is laughter and tears,
courage and timidity, weakness and strength,
sorrow and death. Even those who have
fought know very little of what took place,
they have been mere atoms moving backward
and forward in the vast fluctuation, blinded
in the obscurity of the conflict. For them
the battle has been a mirage having in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
nothing that is fixed or stable, a great hallucination.</p>

<p>The line was taken, but even those who
took part in the operations know not how the
superhuman was accomplished, how the
miracle was performed.</p>

<p>"It was a tough nut to crack," said a
Digger to whom I spoke, asking him of the
battle. "But we got through somehow."</p>

<p>"It was damned stiff," said another,
shrugging his shoulders as if to belittle the
effort of men in the operations. "Damned
stiff, but we had the guns and the
tanks."</p>

<p>"For God's sake don't put your hand on
that!"</p>

<p>It was an officer with two rows of ribbons
on his breast and the gold stripe in triplicate
on his sleeve who spoke. He was a veteran
soldier who had fought in many campaigns
and who knew war as it is waged on more
than one continent. Now he was looking at
one of our party who had bent to lift a German
helmet from the ground near the mouth of
the tunnel. The souvenir searcher held himself
erect and fixed a look of inquiry on the
officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may be a booby trap," the officer
explained.</p>

<p>"That, sir?" he said, in a voice of incredulity.</p>

<p>"Probably not," said the officer. "But
one never knows. When we took Peronne
and the Diggers set about clearing the streets
of dead, some of our boys found a dead German
lying on a stretcher. Two of them
bent down with the intention of lifting the
man and carrying him to a grave. And the
stretcher and the dead man on it and the two
Diggers went sky high, for the contrivance
was attached to a mine by a strand of wire.
On another occasion an officer friend of mine
went into a dug-out in the front line, recently
captured from the Germans. Quite snug and
comfortable. He lived in it for three days,
but at the end of that time it went up, carrying
him with it. It was all planned out before
the Germans left. Somewhere in the roof
of the dug-out was a certain acid, which fell
drop by drop on a wire, eating it away.
When the wire was cut something which it
held up fell, struck a spark and an explosion
took place. Again, a party of Americans
found one of their dead lying on the barbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
wire entanglements in No Man's Land the
other day and they went forward to lift him
off and bury him. An engineer saved the
men by rushing up and yelling to them to
clear off. Then when an examination was
made it was found that the soldier was tied to
the entanglement with a wire and this wire
was connected with an explosive."</p>

<p>"And that's how they wage war!" said
the civilian. "The beasts!"</p>

<p>"It's the nature of the animal," said the
officer with the air of a man pronouncing a
known truth. "When Peronne was taken
it was placed out of bounds for sixty days to
the Australian troops, so that the engineers
could have time to go through the place and
remove all booby-traps. And it was filled
with them. The first two Tommies who
entered the place were blown up. Doors were
tried by the engineers, for doors idly open or
tightly shut were often death-traps. Lift
the latch and something goes bang! and you
go bang with it. Shut a door and hey! an
explosion. 'Twas the same right through the
place. A spade thrown carelessly down, a
clock ticking harmlessly, a rifle flung away, a
trench helmet lying on the street, each and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
any of these might be traps. We have to
move carefully after the retreating Germans,
and mopping up doesn't always consist of
clearing the Huns out of dug-outs but of
clearing up the litter left on the field."</p>

<p>Of this and that the officer spoke, but now
and again he came back to the subject of
booby traps. The man, although a brave
soldier, as the ribbons on his breast and the
service stripes on his sleeve testified, dreaded
the booby traps. He spoke of trip wires on
the field, or wires in the cellars of captured
villages, of wires by the roadway, in the trench
and on the parapet, all connected with land
mines and hidden explosives.</p>

<p>But the process of mopping up has humour
of its own, and he spoke with relish of suspicious
objects lying in towns, villages, in
farmyards, and out on the open land between
the lines. Men gazed at these askance, moved
them gingerly only to find that they were
quite harmless. Once he saw a stretcher
lying in No-Man's Land, and fearing to move
it he tied a rope to one of the handles, came
in to the trench and got the men to pull the
stretcher in. And they pulled and brought
it in, but nothing happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Again he spoke of an incident dealing with
the capture of Peronne. A colonel walking
along a street stopped to peep inside a house
which had stood its beating well. This residence
was apparently used by the Germans
as a battalion headquarters, for a number of
papers littered the floor and on the table was
placed a box of cigars. But what attracted
the officer's eyes was a gold watch hanging
by a copper wire from the wall. His own
wrist watch had got broken that morning
and the officer wanted a watch. But the
wire roused his suspicions. If he pulled it or
tampered with it something of which he could
never give a report might happen.</p>

<p>He decided to work warily, and finding a
string he tied it round the watch, then paying
out the string he walked into the open and
made himself snug in a shell-hole which
yawned on the street. Once there he gave
the string a tug but nothing happened. He
pulled again and again and still the watch
held firm. But on the seventh or eighth tug
the cord came away. He pulled it into the
shell-hole to find nothing in the loop. Getting
to his feet he went into the house. But
imagine his surprise to find the wire hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
empty from the nail to which it was attached.
The watch was gone and it was a week later
that he was able to solve the mystery when
he found a splendid gold watch in the possession
of one of his own men. This Digger
happened to come along when the Colonel
was tugging at the supposed booby trap, took
the watch, put it in his pocket and made his
exit by a back door.</p>

<span class="pfs80">THE DEAD VILLAGE</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">It was grey noon and we found ourselves
on a flat-backed bluff that rose from the
marshes of the Somme. At the base of
this bluff could be seen many openings, telling
of the Germans who had once dug into the
place, fashioning little homes in the wet clay.
The German is a burrowing animal and it is
safe to say that for every shell left by him in
his flight across the Somme (and they are
many) he has left a corresponding dug-out.
These carefully constructed shelters are to be
seen in all localities, in trench, gully, bank,
by roadway, churchyard and farm. His
dug-outs are everywhere, heavily timbered,
strongly propped, snugly roofed. In the
building of these habitations of fear the German
soldier has no equal. The Australian
soldier may have more dash and energy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
fighting than the Boche, the English soldier
more pluck and resource, the Scot more
stubbornness, but none of them can fashion
better dug-outs than the German. Whether
the building is to him an art, profession, or
instinct, the fact remains that his manifest
ability in building is a thing of wonder.</p>

<p>Most of his dug-outs are furnished with due
elegance, from the carpeted and curtained
abodes of officers, to the snug hutments of
the simple soldiers. The officers' chairs are
covered with elegant brocade, the officers'
tables are of carved oak, and here and there
the officers' rooms are lined with rich tapestry.
And all has been taken from the homes of
France, from the château, church and cottage.</p>

<p>Round the bluff on which I stood and as
far away as the eye reached could be seen
innumerable brick red huddles, all that was
left of the villages which once stood on the
Somme field, all that now remains are stumps
of walls, broken-down churches, smashed
doors, paneless windows, desolation and ruin.
At points on the immense landscape can be
seen black blocks of enemy hutments which
have in a measure escaped the ravages of war.
Gun positions can even be located, the guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
idle in their emplacements, howitzers knocked
off their mountings, gun carriages stuck in
the mud, lines of the everlasting wire entanglements
stretching over miles and miles of
fields. Here and there is a signpost with
German directions telling where such and
such a place can be found and where such and
such a road is leading to. The village of
A&mdash;&mdash; lies some distance in front, the village
of B&mdash;&mdash; some distance to rear, and both
heaps of ruins.</p>

<p>Each ruined village has an aspect peculiarly
its own. Each seems to view its evil
hap in its own way and the traveller becomes
conscious of a distinct soul in each huddle of
ruins.</p>

<p>Villers-Bretonneux with many walls standing
and projecting beams and girders rising
over the rubbish seems to groan out:
"Though I am smashed and broken I am not
yet beaten. They've tried to work their will
on me, but for all that here I stand battle-scarred
but indomitable. I have a soul that
still remains my own."</p>

<p>Bray-sur-Somme, resting in a hollow, solitary
and secluded, with its church spire down,
the Christ above the church door lacerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with shrapnel splinters, and the green grass
peeping covertly up from the cracks in the
pavement, wears the air of a hermit who has
cast himself off from the sin and temptation
of the world. In it and around it all is quiet.
Not a sound, not a whisper. It seemed to me
as our party motored through there one day
on our way to Chingnes, that something
personal stood above it, the Spirit of the
village, holding up its hand saying in a whisper:
"Hush! Begone!" The village
detached and alone reminded me of a jungle
animal in pain that creeps into a dark corner
to lick its sores. The life which disturbed the
repose of Bray-sur-Somme, if only for a
moment, was to it a sinful reproach; every
movement, every voice and footfall seemed to
throw it back to brood on its own misery.</p>

<p>Again there is the village that has left
nothing but a memory, a village like Villars-Carbonnel,
utterly dead, defaced off the
world as writing is wiped off a slate, as the
snow is thawed from a garden seat. Nothing
remains of it, not a café sign, not a cobble or
a butt of wall. A sign that I have already
spoken of stands there telling that it marked
the place where once stood Villars-Carbonnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
which is now as dead as the people of yesteryear.
Poor little village! there are tears in
its story, tears for the idle onlooker as well
as for the refugees who will some day return
to know the fate of their native place.</p>

<p>In a steep gully in Arey Wood, south of the
village of Chingnes, we were shown a monster
gun, with a bore of fifteen inches and a barrel
fifty feet in length. The huge machinery of
the mounting, its steel platform embedded in
concrete was sunk into a deep pit surrounded
by blackened and shivered trees. Three
light railway lines ran up to the emplacement,
and dug-outs for the gun crew, partially
completed, were ranged round the base of the
pit.</p>

<p>But the gun was smashed, broken at the
breech, with the helpless barrel lying in the
mud and the gun carriage standing helpless
on its steel platform. Thus it was found by
the men of the 1st Australian Division when
they came forward on the heels of the retreating
Germans in the early days of last August.</p>

<p>The shaping of this gun was certainly one
of the most magnificent struggles of man
against the forces of Nature, the moulding
of the earth to his needs and the fashioning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it towards a desired end. As you look at it,
you can picture the men who went down into
the bowels of the earth, dug and scraped the
iron ore which they sent up from the blackness
of eternal night to the light of day. Then
followed the moment when overburdened
vehicles swept towards some busy centre of
labour, where the ore was shovelled into the
smelting pots. Men sweated and strained
there, worked hard in overheated chambers,
hurrying on the job which they had set out
to do.</p>

<p>And others, wise in their lore, pondered
over plans relating to this and that, elevation
of the monster when in use, the trajectory
of the missiles which it was to vomit forth,
the absorption of recoil and the carriage of
the weapon to its desired emplacement. And
these things were studied and made plain
while the munition worker in the hot suffocating
atmosphere of the casting room
laboured to make shells worthy of the gun.</p>

<p>And one day when the labour was accomplished,
the weapon was sent forth in secrecy
and placed in a tree-lined pocket of ground
behind the German trenches. Here was an
emplacement prepared fit for its installation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and on a movable carriage, a steel ribbed
structure of gigantic proportions, the gun was
placed, its fifty foot barrel rising to the
sky.</p>

<p>Dynamos built in deep dug-outs waited,
ready when the hour came to touch the spark
that would send out the missile of death to
some far off French town, Amiens perhaps,
and wreak vengeance on the simple people
who dwelt there.</p>

<p>Whether or not the shell was fired is a
matter of doubt, but rumour has it that a
shell never passed through the barrel of the
gun. But still it had its toll of victims, for
by the emplacement can now be seen fourteen
graves and the crosses on these graves tell
that the men buried there are German gunners.
The shell bursting in the barrel of the
gun served a purpose, and this was beneficial
to the Allies.</p>

<p>Some day when the war comes to an end,
report has it that the gun will be sent to
Australia, where sightseers in Sydney or
Melbourne will look with awe on the mighty
weapon captured by the Diggers in the great
struggle.</p>

<p>Of this matter I spoke to an Australian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
soldier in London the other day, but he shook
his head.</p>

<p>"You don't think they'll be able to remove
it?" I queried.</p>

<p>"It's not that," he said. "It may be
taken to Australia, but to what city? One
place is jealous of another, and if Sydney
gets the gun, what is Melbourne going to say?
For my own part, I think it would be wise
to leave the gun where it is."</p>

<span class="pfs80">GRAVES</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">There is a certain grave near Peronne,
and in it rests a German machine
gunner, and though the cross over
the grave testifies to the valour of the dead
man it also is witness to the chivalry of the
men who buried him there. The men were
Australian soldiers, brave Diggers who advanced
to the attack and after making rapid
strides they were held up by the fire of a
solitary machine gun that stood immovable
in the rout as a rock in running water. Round
it the retreating army was withering like
snow in a thaw, the whole line bending,
cracking and floating backwards.</p>

<p>Still this gun kept hurling its lead against
the advancing Diggers, cutting great gaps in
their ranks. For a full hour it kept up its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
murderous fire, staying the Australians and
causing them to halt. In vain they streaked
out to the left or right, wormed their way
along folds in the ground or took cover in
natural hollows and advanced from there
when the fire ceased for a space. But the
moment a head showed or a khaki clad body
came into view the gun found voice and swept
its missiles of death across the field.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became silent. The advance
was resumed and the gun was located. Here
was found a solitary German lying dead
beside his weapon with a bullet wound in his
head.</p>

<p>"A brave man!" said the Australians,
looking at the dead man who alone and
unaided held up their advance for an hour.
"We'll bury him!"</p>

<p>And there and then in the emplacement
which he had guarded till death they buried
the German soldier and on the cross over the
man is written "Erected by the &mdash;&mdash; in
admiration of a soldier."</p>

<p>The officer who conducted our party spoke
of another grave which is near the same place,
and which bears on the headstone:</p>

<p>"<em>Here lie two Huns who met a Digger.</em>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>And near it, in terse and forcible language
is inscribed on a second headstone:</p>

<p>"<em>Here lies the Digger.</em>"</p>

<p>Whether this is true or not is impossible
to say. The officer who told me of it merely
got the story of the affair from some other
man who had not seen the headstones, but
who heard of them from a mate. In this way
is rumour carried from mouth to mouth on
the field of battle. But if the story is true,
it shows the grim humour which is the soldier's;
if not true, it shows the same humour
as it takes form in the imagination and makes
itself manifest in dug-out drollery and war
mentality.</p>

<p>The Somme is a land of ruins and graves.
These graves are everywhere by the Amiens-St.
Quentin road, by the road from St.
Quentin to Cambrai and the road from Eitenham
to Bray. Not alone by the roadside are
the brave resting, they sleep in folds of the
earth, on little hillocks, in the shade of broken
spinneys, by the banks of canals and on the
verge of disbanded trenches. Over one heap
of earth can be seen a bayonet topped with
a helmet or cap, over another a rifle with its
barrel stuck in the ground. Crosses stand to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
unknown soldiers, British, French or German,
crosses with names stand singly or in clusters,
telling of the men who have given up their
life in the great war. None of these are
secure from the leprosy of time; the wind,
weather and rain turn them black or green,
blotting out all record or detail. The grass
and weeds grow up around them, covering
them and hiding them from the eyes of men.
The French graves have their red rosettes,
the British graves their black lettering, and
amongst these latter many Australians are
buried far away from the land that gave them
birth.</p>

<p>In the churchyard of Peronne are several
crosses telling of British soldiers buried there.
The inscriptions on the crosses are written in
German and all are couched in a similar
manner:</p>

<p>"Here rests in God, Private &mdash;&mdash; of the
&mdash;&mdash; Regiment."</p>

<p>"The only kindly thing I've ever seen done
by the Germans," said an Australian officer
who was with us as we looked at the graves.</p>

<span class="pfs80">CAMBRAI AND AMIENS</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">We went to the town of Cambrai on
October 13, a famous day in the
history of the town, for it was then
that the British handed the town, captured
by them from the Germans, over to the
French. Sir Douglas Haig and Premier
Clemenceau were there: the French troops
furnishing a guard of honour.</p>

<p>In the distance, while the French were
playing the Marseillaise on the town square,
we could hear the dull thud of shells bursting
in the fields outside the city.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a solemn thanksgiving
for the relief of the town from the Germans
was held in the old cathedral amidst the
wreckage of war, Abbé Thuliez, the heroic
priest who stayed in the town whilst it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in the occupation of the enemy, officiating.
On entering the cathedral it could at once be
seen that the Germans had left a trail of
ruin over the sacred house of prayer. Seats
were broken and overturned, a chair was
attached to the sanctuary lamp and hung
there idly, the pipes of the organ have been
wrenched out and taken away, and candlesticks
looted from the altar were found, on
the entry of the British, tied up in bundles
ready for removal.</p>

<p>Walking through the wide but irregular
streets one was forcibly reminded of the
cunning of those who had been in occupation.
Here and there attached to the doors of
houses were notices put up by the British
engineers. One says "Dangerous," meaning
that suspicious objects in the house are not
to be touched lest they explode a booby trap,
other houses bear the legend "Suspicious,"
and a third notice says "O.K.," meaning that
the engineers have examined the house,
removed anything dangerous and rendered
it safe for habitation.</p>

<p>The big Town Hall is blown down and
gutted with fire. Nothing remains save the
bare walls. The ground floor is littered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
rubble, curtains have been taken down and
carried away, statuary and pictures have been
removed.</p>

<p>We visited a large château on the outskirts
of Cambrai, which was once the residence of
the German Crown Prince. Inside one could
see where the hand of the spoiler had been
busy. Chairs and sofas were stripped of their
tapestry, valuable books had been taken away
and books of lesser value had been tampered
with, slashed with knives and destroyed. In
an upper corner of this building was a nursery
with the children's dolls and rocking horses
torn and lacerated, the doll's tea service
broken and trampled to the ground.</p>

<p>Outside the house runs a light railway under
a line of tall trees. These trees have been cut
down and placed on the rails, blocking all
transport and destroying the picturesque
glory of a beautiful esplanade, on which stands
the statue of Baptiste, the first maker of
cambric, from which Cambrai has taken its
name.</p>

<p>Many ancient towns of France famous in
history and acquiring a fame even more
lasting in their downfall, were visited by our
party in turn. Yesterday it was Peronne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to-day Cambrai, Albert and Amiens to-morrow.
Of Peronne and Cambrai we have
spoken, but of the history of Albert we can
say nothing, knowing so little of its past.
And the Albert of to-day is humbled to the
dust, its cathedral burned to the ground, its
leaning Virgin gone.</p>

<p>On our way back to England we stopped
for a night at Amiens, the one-time capital
of Picardy, the town in which Peter the
Hermit, Apostle of the First Crusade, and
Ducange, the greatest of French scholars, were
born.</p>

<p>Amiens was up till quite recently the
objective of enemy guns and the dumping
ground of bombs emptied from German
aeroplanes. At the present time the refugees
were again returning and many were already
busy at the work of putting the city once
again in order. But great harm has been
done to Amiens, and here and there blocks of
houses are levelled to the ground. Even the
cathedral, begun in the early years of the
thirteenth century, has not escaped the
missiles of war. A German shell has come
through the roof, but by good luck the shell
was a dud and did no injury to the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
beyond breaking a few tiles on the roof and
smashing a flag on the floor.</p>

<p>Shells have fallen all round the building,
smashing many houses in the immediate
neighbourhood and particularly outside the
main entrance, where a café has been levelled
to the ground. In the big building itself a
great deal of stained glass has been broken,
its walls and flying buttresses are scarred and
pitted with splinters from bursting shells.
Within, the choir stalls of the Cathedral, the
high altar, the pictures, pillars and statuary
are protected by high sand-bagged walls that
reach almost to the roof. It is said that the
Germans did their utmost to spare the building.
But judging by the number of houses
in the vicinity knocked down by shell fire
and broken by bombs, it looks as if the
Germans tried to save the sacred pile by
just missing it with the narrowest possible
margin.</p>

<p>Though but three days had passed since we
came through Amiens on our way to the
front, a great change had taken place in the
town. Three days ago it was practically
deserted, for most of those who had gone
away in the face of the big German advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had not yet returned. Windows were then
shuttered, doors boarded, no traffic was to be
seen in the street. Lamps were broken and
the shattered glass lay on the pavements.
Amiens was a dead city lacking light and
radiance by night, movement and sound by
day. Mourning and stupor lay like a pall
over the town. But now on our return we
could see that a great resurrection had taken
place. Lights showed in the shops, women
served in the cafés where the red and blue
bottles flung back the reflection of many
lamps, children were playing on the pavements,
and newsboys were shouting out the
daily papers, English and French, at every
corner. Amiens with usual French perseverance
was accommodating itself to the new
life and settling down again to its ordinary
every-day round of business.</p>

<p>Having seen Amiens Cathedral in the darkness,
we returned to our hotel to find a number
of fresh visitors who had joined our party.
One was Mr. Hughes, Premier of Australia,
who was visiting the troops then billeted in
the back area, drilling and getting fit for
further encounters on the battlefield. For
the night he was stopping in Amiens at our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hotel and on the morrow he was going back
with us to London.</p>

<p>On our entrance to the dining-room we
found one of the officers telling the story of
the bayonet, which he held to be the greatest
weapon used by the fighting man.</p>

<p>"The best weapon of all," he said. "Other
weapons do their bit, the tank, the big gun,
and the rifle, but none are as effective as the
cold steel. When in the early days of the war
the British soldiers went back from Mons
'twas the bayonet that saved them many a
time. The gun did a share, the barbed wire
entanglements were of some service, but when
it came to hand-to-hand fighting there was
only one weapon called into play, the
bayonet."</p>

<p>"The Germans don't like it," some one
said.</p>

<p>"Not they," said the officer, "it's cut and
run when they are up against the steel. But
with the Turk it's a different matter. When
he's cornered he'll fight for his life and make
a good fight of it. He's a splendid man,
Johnnie Turk, a damned good fellow, and one
that can give you a run for your money when
you come in contact with him. And he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
such a queer way of fighting with the steel.
Twists and whirls his bayonet round in a
queer tantalizing manner, and you never
know where you are, whether he's doing it
for a joke or not. But there's some plan in
his capers, as we saw out on the Peninsula.
Some of our boys were inclined to laugh at
Johnnie's capers, but they knew better after
a while, for suddenly the beggar would stop
his gyrations and sweep forward and slash
upwards and probably get home. I saw
many of the Diggers fall to the Turks' bayonet,
but never from a straight thrust forward.
Johnnie always cut upwards.</p>

<p>"The surgeon has never dressed a bayonet
wound," he added. "The weapon is always
fatal."</p>

<p>During the evening we talked of many
things, of incidents of war and peace. The
Premier told us many entertaining stories of
his life in Australia, and one I particularly
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. Hughes in his early days was put
forward as a political candidate for some little
township. This was a place where party
strife was rife and where now and again
matters of import were decided not by peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>ful
argument and gentle discussion, but by
the heavy fists of angry men. One party put
Mr. Hughes forward, another party brought
another person into the limelight and said
that he should be a candidate in preference
to Mr. Hughes. Eventually, it was decided
to put the matter to a vote.</p>

<p>While the voting took place Mr. Hughes
was in some other part of the town dealing
with other affairs. He happened to be
sitting in some house looking out on the
street when he noticed a man in shirt sleeves
coming tearing towards him, his face and neck
beaded with perspiration.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Hughes exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The voting," was the answer. "You're
chosen. Run for your life!"</p>

<span class="pfs80">IN THE CAFÉ</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">The café was crowded, for the Diggers
out of the trenches were making
the most of their short stay in the
back area. To-morrow or the day after they
would be going back again and anything
might happen up there. "Laugh and be
happy, for to-morrow we die," seemed to be
the motto of the evening.</p>

<p>The place was crowded, principally with
Australian soldiers, though here and there
in the room, sitting at tables playing dominoes,
were a number of Frenchmen. Cordial relations
bind the poilu and the Digger in terms
of friendship, for the Australians love the
French, and the French love the Australians.</p>

<p>The Diggers appreciate that everyday good-humour,
generous warmth and eager hospitality
which gives tone and colour to the lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the French people. This courtesy and
kindness is not for a certain occasion with
these people, it is their very nature. They
seem to like to see everybody happy and in
good spirits, and go out of their way to befriend
and succour the men in khaki when these
latter are in need of help. Nothing goes
farther to show the temper of a people than
their behaviour in matters of trifling importance,
for when all is said and done trifles
make up the great sum of human existence;
take them away from life and what is left?</p>

<p>The civilian population of France show
their appreciation of the Australians in many
ways. They are ready at any moment to
give rooms in their homes to men back from
the lines, to prepare hot meals for them, dry
their clothes, wash and mend their underclothing.</p>

<p>On one occasion the Prefect of the Department
of the Somme on behalf of the French
Government conveyed to the Australian Commander
the admiration and appreciation of
the French people for the Australian Army,
not only for the work done by the soldiers
in the field when they fought against the
invaders of France, but also for the behaviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of the troops when quartered in the back
area with the civilian population, and the
care taken of all property belonging to the
people.</p>

<p>Wherever the Diggers go they seem to win
the universal affection of women and children.
An officer told me how these big men, rough
in many ways, fiery in language and frank
to the point of brutality at times, when they
came to the ruined homes near Villers-Bretonneux,
set themselves during lulls in the
fighting to the kindly job of repairing the
houses, salving the property, setting the
religious pictures at correct angles on the walls
and mending the broken shrines. They placed
cradles and children's toys in the safety of the
cellars so that these might be ready to hand
when the little ones returned to their homes
again. Having done this they took up the
fighting again, so that the country might be
made ready for the home-coming of the
refugees.</p>

<p>Among the soldiers in the café were many
of those who had fought at Villers-Bretonneux
and made history in defence of Amiens.
But at present a distance removed from the
scene of war they were absorbed in amuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>ments
and games that caused them to forget
all about the life of the firing line.</p>

<p>At one corner of the room half a dozen men
were playing "Two up," winning and losing
much money, others were talking of past
operations on the field, tracing with beer-wetted
fingers the lines held by themselves
and the enemy. A tall dark man sat by the
stove, his half-empty glass on the floor at his
feet and a big bowled pipe in his mouth.</p>

<p>"What's your battalion?" he suddenly
inquired, fixing his eye on a man near him,
one whom he had never met before. This
Digger, a youngster with a slight fringe of
down on his upper lip, was leaning both elbows
on the table and gazing contemplatively at
the empty glass which stood in front of him.</p>

<p>"I'm fifth&mdash;&mdash;" was the answer.</p>

<p>"Know old Harry C&mdash;&mdash;?" inquired the
tall man.</p>

<p>"Should think I do," said the other.
"Knew him in Brighton. Played football
against his team. Fine fellow, old Harry."</p>

<p>"Killed?"</p>

<p>"Ay. On the Peninsula. Met him there
one day," said the youngster. "God's truth!
You could have knocked me down dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
'Harry!' I said. 'Where have I struck you?'
he asked me. 'I've kicked some goals
against your team,' said I. 'And to meet
you here. But wait till we go back again
and have another game of football. I'll kick
your head off.' 'Not much chance of a
boose here,' said Harry, 'might as well be
cinder humping in hell.' That was all at the
time. He was going up to the front line, but
he promised to call round and see me when he
came out that night. We were supports.
And I waited for old Harry. 'Twas dark
when his platoon came out. I went to meet
him. 'Where's Harry C&mdash;&mdash;?' I called to
the fellows. 'The footballer?' some one
asked me. 'Yes, old Harry C&mdash;&mdash;' I told
the man. 'He's killed,' said the man, 'blown
to pieces.'"</p>

<p>"It's hard when you look back on it," said
the tall dark soldier by the stove. "So
many...."</p>

<p>At this moment a man rose from a table
near the door and commenced to recite a
poem. All stopped their various pursuits
to listen, for the Australians love poetry,
especially when it recalls memories of the land
they have left. The game of "Two up"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was discontinued and the French soldiers
stopped their draughts and dominoes to listen.</p>

<p>The man who stood on the floor spoke his
lines in a manner exalted and serious, his hat
thrust back on his head and the movement
of arms and hands accompanying the recital
adding to its force and passion. In the utterance
it was impossible to discover anything
beyond the deep feeling which he had called
up to interpret the spirit of the poem. The
verses written long ago had in them a gift of
prophecy. They told of a war to be, the war
in which the Australian soldier was now taking
part.</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"All creeds and trades will have soldiers there&mdash;give every class its due,</p>
<p class="verse">And there'll be many a clerk to spare for the pride of the jackeroo,</p>
<p class="verse">They'll fight for honour and fight for love and a few will fight for gold,</p>
<p class="verse">For the devil below and for God above as our fathers fought of old,</p>
<p class="verse">And some half blind with exultant tears and some stiff-lipped, stern-eyed</p>
<p class="verse">For the pride of a thousand after years and the old eternal pride&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<p class="verse">The soul of the world they will feel and see in the chase and the grim retreat,</p>
<p class="verse">They'll know the glory of victory&mdash;and the grandeur of defeat."</p>
</div>
</div></div>


<p>This was but a beginning. Other men rose
and declaimed verses that told of life in the
homeland. One poem after another was
recited. "The Old Whim Horse," "Out
Back," "Sheedy Was Dying," poems dealing
with the swagman, shearer and sundowner
and telling of the Paroo parched with long
drouths or blooming with the wattle blossoms.
For the moment all the company were back
there, and the patronne, with bottles red and
blue gleaming on the shelves over her head,
viewed the big boys with eyes that from time
to time were moist with tears.</p>

<p>For did she not know them, those who were
now for a moment under the roof of her café,
who would leave to-morrow night, go up to
the trenches, and come back again in a week
or a fortnight. But not all. In that was the
tragedy: some would come back again. But
not all. Some would remain up there resting
for ever near the lip of the trench. She knew
of the grim tragedy of the trenches and felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for the boys. Her own husband dead and
buried at Verdun! But it was war.</p>

<p>And at that moment the tall, dark man by
the stove rose, squared his shoulders, gave a
preliminary cough and started a poem.</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"East and backward pale faces turning&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse4">That's how the dead men lie,</p>
<p class="verse">Gaunt arms stretched with a voiceless yearning&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse4">That's how the dead men lie.</p>
<p class="verse">Oft in the fragrant hush of nooning,</p>
<p class="verse">Hearing again their mother's crooning,</p>
<p class="verse">Wrapt for aye in a dreadful swooning,</p>
<p class="verse4">That's how the dead men lie...."</p>
</div>
</div></div>


<p>It was now on the verge of closing time and
military policemen were already standing at
the door, listening to the poems and loth to
put a stop to the performance in the café. A
young giant, in the making of whom the gods
forgot none of their ancient craft, was standing
in the centre of the room telling the story of
"Clancy of the Overflow."</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse">"In my wild erratic fancy visions came to me of Clancy</p>
<p class="verse">Gone a-droning down the Cooper where the Western drovers go.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<p class="verse">As the stock are slowly stringing Clancy rides behind them singing,</p>
<p class="verse">For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know...."</p>
</div>
</div></div>


<p>The poem told of an incident of years far
back and the young reciter, if he had once
wrought as a clerk, was living a life now such
as Clancy of the Overflow had never known
and never would know unless, as perhaps was
the case, he had given up shearing and taken
to the life of soldiering.</p>

<p>But away here in a café of the back area,
where the patronne sold weak red wine and
weaker beer, the Diggers' thoughts were of
home, of the land they left and for which they
were fighting.</p>

<p>These men who dwell in France are creating
for Australia a national sentiment, and
gaining for themselves a wide outlook in
their travels and accomplishments afield.
At present the war waged ten thousand miles
away from the Southern Continent is welding
together the people's outlook, aspiration and
sympathy. Men from all parts of the continent,
from out back and from the sea-coast
are grouped together in one great brotherhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
fighting for a common cause, and the ground
over which they fight is the one central point
on which all eyes of Australia are directed.
Back home many voices are raised in declamation
or praise of this or that political move
or industrial policy, but on one point there
is complete and unanimous acquiescence, and
that one point is the prosecution of the war
towards a successful conclusion. It must be
waged till the end, until Germany is beaten
and the wrong done to the world, to France
and Belgium, righted.</p>

<p>And so the Australians make great battle
in the mud of France and Flanders, fighting
with heroic persistence, carving the way to
victory. As we remember what the Diggers
have done at Gallipoli, Polygon, Pozieres and
Peronne, we may quote the famous couplet
from the prologue to "The Revenge," played
by a company of convicts in Sydney, 1796,
and thereto add two lines of our own making:</p>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse">We left our country for our country's good.</p>

Author of "Children of the Dead End,"
"The Rat Pit," "The Great Push,"
etc. Crown 8vo. 6/- net.</p>


<p class="drop-capx fs90">In his new book Mr. MacGill gives a complete
picture of Irish peasant life in his native county
of Donegal. Doalty Gallagher, becoming tired
of journalism and Fleet Street, returns to the
peace and quiet of his old home. Here he sets himself
to work on the land, and to renew his acquaintance
with the people whom he had known in his
childhood&mdash;Grania Coolin, the lone widow woman,
Dennys, the drover and man of the world, Owen
Briney, the close-fisted farmer, Oidny Leahys, the
peasant philosopher, and Sheila Dermod, the fairest
girl in all the barony. Doalty finds however, that the
years spent in the land of the Sassenach have changed
him. He has lost the simple and trusting faith of his
fathers, and when, desperately in love with Sheila,
he asks her to marry him, the priest intervenes and
Doalty is forced to leave the country, an object of
universal suspicion. The peasantry of Glenmornan,
turf-diggers, creel-makers, potheen-distillers, cattle-drovers
and knitters of stockings are presented with
insight, freshness and sympathy. The petty vices
of the villagers of Greenanore, the gombeen men,
the rent-collectors and the priests are laid bare by
Mr. MacGill, who knows them as few other writers
know them. He is not an artist from without,
looking in and describing what he sees, but one who
tells of what he himself has felt and known.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">"Children of the Dead End" came
upon the literary world as something
of a surprise; it dealt with a phase
of life about which nothing was
known. It was compared with the work of
Borrow and Kipling. Incidentally three editions,
aggregating 10,000 copies, were called for within
fifteen days. In his new book Mr. MacGill still
deals with the underworld he knows so well.
He tells of a life woven of darkest threads, full
of pity and pathos, lighted up by that rare and
quaint humour that made his first book so attractive.
"The Rat-Pit" tells the story of an Irish
peasant girl brought up in an atmosphere of
poverty, where the purity of the poor and the
innocence of maidenhood stand out in simple
relief against a grim and sombre background.
Norah Ryan leaves her home at an early age, and
is plunged into a new world where dissolute and
heedless men drag her down to their own miry
level. Mr. MacGill's lot has been cast in strange
places, and every incident of his book is pregnant
with a vivid realism that carries the conviction
that it is a literal transcript from life, as in fact
it is. Only last summer, just before he enlisted,
Mr. MacGill spent some time in Glasgow reviving
old memories of its underworld. His characters
are mostly real persons, and their sufferings, the
sufferings of women burdened and oppressed with
wrongs which women alone bear, are a strong
indictment against a dubious civilisation.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
